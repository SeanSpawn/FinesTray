# Privacy Policy

Finestray does not transmit any data, personal or otherwise.

You can opt in to enabling the debug logging feature of Finestray, which puts some debugging information into a log
file on your computer. Some of the information in this file may be sensitive (for example. the titles of all the windows
that are open on your system, and the paths of the executables that created the windows). Finestray never transmits this
file anywhere for any reason.

However, you may choose to provide the debug log file to someone (for example to report an issue on the Finestray web
site) to assist with debugging or troubleshooting efforts. If you choose to provide a debug log file, you are
responsible for removing any sensitive information from it prior to sharing. Also, please be aware that issue reporting
on the GitHub [issue reporting page](https://github.com/benbuck/finestray/issues) is public, including your user name
and associated data, and any information you provide about the issue, including any debug log files that you upload.
