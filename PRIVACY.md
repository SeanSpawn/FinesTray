# Privacy Policy

Finestray does not transmit any data, personal or otherwise.

You can opt in to enabling the debug logging feature of Finestray, which may put some sensitive information into a log
file (for example. the titles of all the windows that are open on your system, and the paths of the executables that
created the windows). This log file is saved on your device, and Finestray never transmits it anywhere for any reason.

However, you may choose to provide the debug log file to someone (for example to report an issue on the Finestray web
site) to assist with debugging or troubleshooting efforts. Please be aware that issue reporting on the GitHub
[issue reporting page](https://github.com/benbuck/finestray/issues) is public, including your user name and associated
data, and any information you provide about the issue, including log files that you upload. If you do choose to provide
a log file, it's strongly recommended that you first remove any data from it that you don't want to share.
